  <h2>How did Taya Cake start?</h1>
 
  <p>Taya Cake Bakery started its project in August of 2021, but the baker loved making cakes since 2010. She never considered opening a bakery because of her young age and the idea of home projects and bakeries not being popular at that time.  How did you get this idea?  In the past, she enjoyed watching videos of Korean bakers on YouTube.  On one of the channels she was watching, there was a big bakery that was in the cake business.  She fell in love with this channel, started taking some of her videos to TikTok, and went viral that she wasn't expecting.  I started getting messages through Instagram.  They asked her to bake some cakes for them, and it was an opportunity for her, as she said earlier that she had an old experience with cake and she had a talent for drawing at the same time, and this helped her draw a lot on the cake, but she still feared that idea and presented the idea to her sister and encouraged her to do so.  The idea, and indeed she opened an account via Instagram, and requests poured in and developed her drawing skills, and she now has 4 thousand followers on Instagram, and she is still seeking to develop more, so the students of Princess Noura University decided to support Taya Cake to move forward by opening a website for her.</p>
